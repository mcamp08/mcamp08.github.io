        <p class = "normal-text">Dear diary,<br>
           my name is Harry Pitts. My birthday is February 29 and am 12 years old (but have had 3 birthdays) and live in Olklahoma City. These are my favorite things:<p>
        
        <ul class = "normal-text">
            
            <li>My favorite color is chartreuse</li>
            <li>My favorite food is grapes dipped in guacamole</li>
            <li>My favorite animals are axolotl</li>
            <li>My favorite sport is curling (it's the only sport I play and I am a sweeper)</li>
            <li>My favorite hobby is staring at snails</li>
            
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Tuesday, May 19<h2>
        
        <p class = "normal-text">Today was terrible. The people running the curling practice place accidentally had the heat on 80Â° so all the ice melted, and we missed our 6 hour practice after school. I'm really bummed (and still finishing homework), that I don't even want to talk about today anymore. </p>
